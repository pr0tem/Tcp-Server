# Tcp-Server

This Tcp Server can read input from clients who is connected and prints it in the console.

The server has use of the system.net.sockets, and the system.threading classes.

If my teacher is actually reading this plz let me skip class for the whole year.

btw, i add the client i made for testing it is client.py just add the port under port
and if you dont know how to use the client beacuse it written  in python,
get away from me and my code.
